## Project Overview
The project involves creating an advanced alarm clock that features custom characters, adjustable times, and an alarm system. It uses components such as an Arduino Uno, I2C Bus and LCD display to achieve its functionality. The custom characters enhance the user interface, while the adjustable times and alarm system provide flexibility and practicality.

## Schematics
The [schematics](schematics) folder contains circuit diagrams to guide you through the wiring process. Each connection is clearly labeled to ensure accuracy and ease of assembly.


## 3D Print Files
In the [3DPrintFiles](3DPrintFiles) folder, you'll find STL files for 3D printing custom enclosures and parts for the project. These files are designed to fit the components perfectly, providing a neat and professional finish to your project.

## Arduino Code
The [code](Code) folder contains the Arduino sketches necessary to run the project. Each script is well-documented with comments explaining the functionality of different sections.

## How to Use
1. Download or Clone the Repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TristanCD116/Arduino-Clock.git
```

2. Assemble the Hardware: Follow the schematics to wire your components correctly.

3. 3D Print the Enclosures: Use the provided STL files to print the necessary parts.

4. Upload the Code: Open the Arduino IDE, load the provided sketches, and upload them to your Arduino board.

5. Run and Test: Power up your device and observe its functionality.
